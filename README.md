# Spark ETL for Sparkify's Data Lake

## Backgroud

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

## Objective

Build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, process them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables for the analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs the users are listening to. 

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- pyspark 2.0+
- configparser

## Data Sources
Datasets reside in S3:

Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`  
Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

Log data json path: `s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json`
`song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`
`

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```json
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

 ```log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json```
 ```log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis
Using the song and log datasets, we created a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

### Fact Table
1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
     - *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent*  

### Dimension Tables
2. **users** - users in the app
     - *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*
         
3. **songs** - songs in music database
     - *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*

4. **artists** - artists in music database
     - *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*
     
5. **time** - timestamps of records in **songplays** broken down into specific units
     - *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*

## Guideline
1. ```etl.py```: load data from S3, process the data and transform them into star schema, and store the fact and dimension tables back to S3 in parquet format
2. ```dwh.cfg```: stores AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

## Project Steps

1. Create Access Key ID and Secret Access Key (or use existing one if already had)
2. Add Access Key ID and Secret Access Key to ```dwh.cfg```.
5. Run **etl.py** to load data from S3 as well as to load data from processed tables back to S3 as parquet files.
4. Check the parquet files for the fact and dimension tables are created in the S3 bucket 
6. Run any analytic queries you are interested on the S3 parquet files to compare your results with the expected results.

Example queries: How many songs are played in Oakland Hayward, Sanfranciso?
```spark.sql
spark.sql(
     """
     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM  public.songplays
     WHERE location = 'San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA';
     """
)

```
Results: `3`
